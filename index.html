        <!-- Project 1 -->
        <div class="project">
            <p class="project-date">Date: May 2025</p>
            <h2 class="project-title"><a href="https://github.com/feliciadss/kalman (1).pdf" target="_blank">State Estimation with the Kalman Filter: From Simulation to Real Data (FR)</a></h2>
            <p class="project-description">This project investigates the Kalman filter in both 1D and multidimensional settings to estimate physical quantities such as position, speed, and acceleration. The first part presents a detailed derivation and implementation of the 1D Kalman filter in a simulated radar-tracking scenario, illustrating the filter’s prediction and correction steps, noise modeling, and convergence properties. The second part applies the multidimensional Kalman filter to real sensor data collected during a parabolic flight. The model includes altitude and vertical speed, governed by equations of uniformly accelerated motion. Results show the filter's ability to smooth noisy measurements, estimate unmeasured states, and quantify uncertainty through confidence ellipses. The project also discusses Schur-stability, the behavior of the Riccati equation, and the practical robustness of the Kalman filter in real-world conditions.</p>

            <h2 class="project-title"><a href="https://github.com/feliciadss/projet_envi2 (2).pdf" target="_blank">Reducing Uncertainty in Climate Projections with Statistical Methods (FR)</a></h2>
            <p class="project-description">This project investigates how to reduce uncertainty in future temperature projections using CMIP6 climate model outputs and historical observations. Four methods are compared: (1) simple multi-model averaging, (2) weighted averaging based on model performance and independence (Brunner method), (3) linear regression using emergent constraints, and (4) the Kalman filter (univariate and multivariate forms). Each method is tuned to optimize predictive performance using cross-validation or RMSE. The Kalman filter provides a Bayesian approach to combining observations and model ensembles, using analytical updates under Gaussian assumptions. Multivariate extensions (PCA, random forests) are also tested. Results show that the Kalman filter and linear regression reduce uncertainty by up to 30%, though performance depends on model assumptions and predictor design. This study highlights the trade-offs between simplicity, interpretability, and predictive accuracy in climate ensemble post-processing.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <p class="project-date">Date: Apr 2025</p>
            <h2 class="project-title"><a href="https://github.com/feliciadss/elephant (3).pdf" target="_blank">Asymptotic Analysis of the Elephant Random Walk (FR)</a></h2>
            <p class="project-description">This project explores the long-memory Elephant Random Walk, where each step depends on a random past step, modulated by a memory parameter p ∈[0,1]. We study the asymptotic behavior of the walk using martingale theory. The work includes the construction of associated martingales, analysis of the increasing process, convergence results, and a central limit theorem. Simulations illustrate the different regimes (diffusive, critical, superdiffusive), and a statistical method is implemented to estimate the memory parameter.</p>

        <!-- Project 4 -->
        <div class="project">
            <p class="project-date">Date: Feb 2025</p>
            <h2 class="project-title"><a href="https://github.com/feliciadss/projet.html" target="_blank">Occupancy Modelling and Power Analysis of Trithemis annulata in Urban Wetlands (FR)</a></h2>
            <p class="project-description">This project uses occupancy models to study the distribution of Trithemis annulata, a thermophilic dragonfly species, in Bordeaux Métropole. Two simulation studies assess the statistical power to detect an effect of land artificialization under different sampling designs. In the homogeneous design (25 fixed sites over 5 years), the power was insufficient to detect a moderate effect (β = –2). A mixed design combining fixed and rotating sites yielded slightly better detection rates. Real data from citizen science programs (2018–2023) were then used to model species occurrence as a function of urbanization (MOS11) and detectability as a function of weather conditions and vegetation. The results showed no significant effect of landscape variables, while temperature emerged as the only strong predictor of detection. Power simulations based on the real sampling design confirmed a low capacity (≈17%) to detect a true effect. These findings highlight the need to adapt monitoring strategies—through increased effort or climate-aware sampling—to improve the reliability of ecological inferences.</p>

            <p class="project-description">This project explores the factors influencing ozone (O₃) concentrations in Périgueux throughout 2024, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover patterns and relationships among variables. Key findings reveal that ozone levels are strongly influenced by meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Seasonal trends show higher concentrations during summer, driven by elevated temperatures and dry conditions, while autumn and winter are characterized by lower levels due to increased humidity and precipitation. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the atmospheric dynamics affecting ozone, supporting informed environmental decision-making.</p>

            <p class="project-description">This project explores the calculation and definition of an average in a non-convex geographical context, specifically focusing on Croatia. Given Croatia's crescent-shaped, non-convex structure, conventional averaging methods may result in a mean value that lies outside the country's borders—an impractical and unacceptable outcome. The research seeks to develop an alternative definition of "average" that remains within the geographic boundaries, maintaining the properties of a traditional average when applied to convex spaces.</p>
